# GW Module 2 Excel and VBA
## Overview of Project

Take the challenge starter code that was developed for Steve and refactor it to run more efficiently. Produce analysis of 2017 and 2018 to highlight which stocks are performing positively and negatively over time. 

## Results

Stocks in 2017 had greater returns with the exception of "TERP". The only stocks that performed positively in 2018 were "ENPH" and "RUN" which also were more than 200% increased in terms of Total Daily Volume metrics. This indicates that these companies were heavily perceived by the trading population to be hot stocks.
